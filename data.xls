The 8-outlet UPS is ideal protection for your home office or media center components, including computers, routers, printers, NAS drives, HDTVs, Blu-ray players, game consoles, media players, DVRs and audio receivers.Allows Time to Back Up Critical Files During a Blackout Backup support allows you to work through short power failures, and gives you enough time to safely save files and shut down your system in case of a prolonged blackout. Backup time varies according to load, but the line-interactive UPS system should keep an energy-efficient desktop computer with LCD monitor powered as long as 40 minutes. During normal operation, incoming utility power keeps the UPS battery fully charged, so backup power will always be available. The hot-swappable internal batteries can be replaced by the user.Connects Your Equipment to 8 NEMA 5-15R OutletsFour 5-15R outlets provide both battery backup and surge protection for your computer, monitor and other crucial components. The other four 5-15R outlets are surge-protected only for printers, scanners and other non-essential equipment. Four outlets-two battery/surge and two surge-only-are spaced apart from the others to accommodate bulky transformers. Three are ECO outlets designed to save you money and protect the environment (see below).Highly Efficient UPS Helps You Save Money and Protect the EnvironmentThis highly efficient UPS system helps you save money and energy. An ECO power-saving option features three ECO outlets-two surge-only, one surge- and battery-protected-that turn off automatically when the device connected to the Battery Backup Master Outlet is powered down or in sleep mode. These outlets are recommended for printers, desk lamps and other non-essential peripherals that don't need to be operational all the time.Even Backs up Essential Data When You Aren't AroundUse the included USB cable to connect the USB-B port to your computer. Working with Tripp Lite's free downloadable PowerAlert software, this optional feature can enable safe unattended system shutdown and file saves in the event of a prolonged power failure when you aren't around.Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) Corrects Low-Voltage ConditionsAVR protects your equipment from incremental hardware damage, data loss and performance problems caused by brownouts. The ECO1000LCD can correct brownouts as low as 86V back to nominal 120V power without drawing on the battery backup needed to support your equipment during a blackout. 316 Joules Fight Back Against Unexpected Power SurgesA 316-joule surge suppression rating protects connected components from the harmful effects of power surges. Dual network data line surge suppression jacks protect a wired peripheral from dangerous surges on a single 10/100Base-T or dial-up network connection.USB Charging Ports Keep Mobile Devices Fully Powered for Immediate UseTwo 5V USB ports share 2.1 amps of maximum charge current for charging smartphones, tablets, MP3 players and other essential mobile devices compatible with USB chargers. These ports are intended only for USB charging, which is available when the UPS system is turned on and receiving utility power.Combats Electromagnetic Interference That Can Harm EquipmentVarious electromagnetic and radio sources found in virtually every home and business can cause disruptive interference on the AC line.

The 10-outlet UPS is ideal protection for your home office or media center components, including computers, routers, printers, NAS drives, HDTVs, Blu-ray players, game consoles, media players, DVRs and audio receivers.Allows Time to Back Up Critical Files During a Blackout Backup support allows you to work through short power failures, and gives you enough time to safely save files and shut down your system in case of a prolonged blackout. Backup time varies according to load, but the line-interactive UPS system should keep an energy-efficient desktop computer with LCD monitor powered as long as 75 minutes. During normal operation, incoming utility power keeps the UPS battery fully charged, so backup power will always be available. The hot-swappable internal batteries can be replaced by the user.Connects Your Equipment to 10 NEMA 5-15R OutletsFive 5-15R outlets provide both battery backup and surge protection for your computer, monitor and other crucial components. The other five 5-15R outlets are surge-protected only for printers, scanners and other non-essential equipment. Two outlets-one battery/surge and one surge-only-are spaced apart from the others to accommodate bulky transformers. Four are ECO outlets designed to save you money and protect the environment (see below).ENERGY STAR-Certified to Help You Save Money and Protect the EnvironmentBy meeting strict EPA efficiency guidelines, this ENERGY STAR-certified UPS system helps you save money and energy. An ECO power-saving option features four ECO outlets-three surge-only, one surge- and battery-protected-that turn off automatically when the device connected to the Battery Backup Master Outlet is powered down or in sleep mode. These outlets are recommended for printers, desk lamps and other non-essential peripherals that don't need to be operational all the time.Even Backs up Essential Data When You Aren't AroundUse the included USB cable to connect the USB-B port to your computer. Working with Tripp Lite's free downloadable PowerAlert software, this optional feature can enable safe unattended system shutdown and file saves in the event of a prolonged power failure when you aren't around.Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) Corrects Low-Voltage ConditionsAVR protects your equipment from incremental hardware damage, data loss and performance problems caused by brownouts. The ECO1300LCD can correct brownouts as low as 86V back to nominal 120V power without drawing on the battery backup needed to support your equipment during a blackout. 316 Joules Fight Back Against Unexpected Power SurgesA 316-joule surge suppression rating protects connected components from the harmful effects of power surges. Dual network data line surge suppression jacks protect a wired peripheral from dangerous surges on a single 10/100Base-T or dial-up network connection.USB Charging Ports Keep Mobile Devices Fully Powered for Immediate UseTwo 5V USB ports share 2.1 amps of maximum charge current for charging smartphones, tablets, MP3 players and other essential mobile devices compatible with USB chargers. These ports are intended only for USB charging, which is available when the UPS system is turned on and receiving utility power.Combats Electromagnetic Interference That Can Harm EquipmentVarious electromagnetic and radio sources found in virtually every home and business can cause disruptive interference on the AC line.

The industrial bulkhead adapter and two female USB-A connectors are designed to withstand dust, debris and moisture that could threaten your IT infrastructure. An included dust cap protects the connectors when they aren't in use.IP67 Rating Denotes Resistance to Dust and WaterThe IP67 rating means the USB3 coupler is not only 100% protected against dust, but also able to endure immersion in one meter of water for up to 30 minutes with no damage or decline in performance, making the coupler ideal for basement applications. For applications that require IP67 protection, use the coupler with a Tripp Lite N206-SB01-IND surface-mount box and U325-Series USB 3.0 cables. If only IP44 protection against splashing water from all directions is required, pair the coupler with a N206-FP01-IND, N206-FP02-IND or N206-FP04-IND wall plate and the U325-Series cables.Heavy Shielding Protects Your Network Data from Destructive Line NoiseThe U325-000-IND's shielded construction helps fight against EMI/RFI line noise that interferes with your signal and can distort or destroy data. Electromagnetic interference and radio frequency interference can be created by electric motors, power cables, welding equipment and other heavy machinery frequently found in industrial applications.Supports USB 3.0 Speeds for a Faster, More Efficient SignalThis USB 3.0 coupler supports data transfer rates up to 5 Gbps-10 times faster than USB 2.0. Its bi-directional data interface allows data to flow both directions simultaneously, increasing theoretical bandwidth by 10 times for efficient power and little wait-time. The U325-000-IND is also backward compatible with previous USB generations.TAA-Compliant for GSA Schedule PurchasesThe U325-000-IND is compliant with the Federal Trade Agreements Act (TAA), which makes it eligible for GSA (General Services Administration) Schedule and other federal procurement contracts.Lifetime WarrantyThe U325-000-IND is backed by a lifetime warranty, ensuring reliability and performance."	https://ec.synnex.com/ecx/part/techNote.html?skuNo=5322804,https://ec.synnex.com/ecx/part/techNote.html?skuNo=5322804,https://ec.synnex.com/ecx/part/techNote.html?skuNo=5322804	U325-000-IND,P586-010-DVI,P586-003-DVI

It's 1968 and after years of combat in Vietnam, Lincoln Clay knows this truth: family isn't who you're born with, it's who you die for. Now back home in New Bordeaux, Lincoln is set on escaping a criminal past. But when his surrogate family, the black mob, is betrayed and wiped out by the Italian Mafia, Lincoln builds a new family on the ashes of the old and blazes a path of military-grade revenge through those responsible. Intense gun fights, visceral hand-to-hand combat, white knuckle driving and street smarts will all be needed. But with the right crew, tough decisions and some dirty hands, it's possible to make it to the top of the city's underworld.  NEW BORDEAUX, A REIMAGINED 1968 NEW ORLEANS: A vast, diverse and seedy open world ruled by the mob and corrupt officials and richly detailed with the sights, sounds and emotionally-charged social atmosphere of the era.  AN UNINTENDED AND LETHAL ANTI-HERO: Be Lincoln Clay, an orphan and Vietnam veteran hell bent on revenge against the Italian Mafia for the brutal slaughter of the black mob, the closest thing to family he's ever had.  REVENGE YOUR WAY: Choose your own personal play-style, from brute force and blazing guns to stalk-and-kill tactics as you use Lincoln's military training and gathered intel to tear down the Italian Mafia.   A NEW FAMILY ON THE ASHES OF THE OLD: Build a new criminal empire in your own unique way by deciding which of your lieutenants you reward, and which you betray"		G3Q-00193,G3Q-00192,G3Q-00191

"Overcooked is a chaotic couch co-op cooking game for one to four players. Working as a team, you and your fellow chefs must prepare, cook and serve up a variety of tasty orders before the baying customers storm out in a huff. Sharpen your knives and dust off your chef's whites, there isn't mushroom for error and the steaks are high in these crazy kitchens! The Onion Kingdom is in danger and only the finest cooking can save it! In Overcooked players must journey through a variety of cruel and unusual kitchens on their quest to become master chefs capable of conquering an ancient edible evil which plagues the land. Play solo or engage in classic, chaotic couch co-op for up to four players in both co-operative and competitive challenge modes. You'll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together in order to become the most effective and ultimate team! Key Features: A Culinary Quest - The Onion Kingdom is a rich world full of cruel and unusual kitchens for you to conquer. Take part in an epic journey and tackle an increasingly challenging and bizarre gauntlet of kitchens which will push your skills of co-operation and co-ordination to the very limits. Each level brings a new challenge for you and your team to overcome, whether it's sliding around on a pirate ship, moving between speeding trucks, cooking on an ice floe or serving food in the bowels of a fiery underworld, each level will test the mettle of even the bravest chefs. Simple Controls/Deep Challenge - Overcooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun, but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their actions when the pizza hits the fan, that's when only a well-oiled team of super-chefs will come out on top! Different Ways to Play - Whether indulging in deep fried local co-op or sauteed single player, as you play through the game you'll unlock new levels, new chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen. However you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get ready to enter the kitchen!"		G3Q-00297,7D6-00016,G3Q-00260

Cumulative leakage current of all connected equipment is less than 100 microamps.Connect Your Equipment to 6 IEC 320 C13 OutletsSix C13 hospital-grade outlets provide both battery backup and surge protector for your mobile medical equipment, such as computers, monitors and lab equipment. A 340-joule surge suppression rating protects connected components from the harmful effects of power surges.Combats Electromagnetic Interference That Can Harm EquipmentVarious electromagnetic and radio sources found in virtually every home and business can cause disruptive interference on the AC line. Known as EMI (electromagnetic interference) and RFI (radio frequency interference), this line noise is a common cause of performance problems and can lead to incremental hardware damage, data corruption and audio/video transmission problems. This medical-grade UPS system incorporates technology that filters out disruptive line noise so that it won't affect your equipment.Easy-to-Read LEDs and Alarm Report Real-Time UPS and Power StatusFront-panel LED indicators monitor essential information, such as line power, battery power, overload, voltage regulation and battery low/replace status. An audible alarm will sound in case of low battery, excessive load and power failure.Saves Your Files, Even When You're Away.USB and DB9 serial ports connect to your computer with the included cables. These ports communicate with Tripp Ite's free downloadable PowerAlert software for safe, unattended system shutdown and file saves in the event of a prolonged power failure.Tower Form Factor for Easy Placement on a Nurse's Station or Mobile Medical Cart.The long-lasting PVC housing fits easily on a desktop, shelf or anywhere else power is needed. The 15-centimeter (six-inch) dongle with hospital-grade C14 plug connects to a properly grounded AC wall outlet."		SMX700HGL,SMX1200XLHGL,U420-003-5A

It more than doubles the service life of an equivalent lead acid battery, and offers up to three times more charge/discharge cycles. It recharges to 100% capacity in less than three hours, making the lithium UPS system an ideal backup in case of power outage. The LiFePO4 battery has 60% the weight of an equivalent lead acid battery, which reduces the overall UPS weight.120-Volt Battery Backup Keeps Equipment Operating Through Short Power FailuresThe SMART1000RM2UL provides up to 20 minutes (half load) and 8.3 minutes (full load) of battery backup, as well as AC power protection, for critical server, network and telecom equipment. In case of a prolonged blackout, the single-phase lithium UPS system gives you enough time to save important data and perform an orderly system shutdown.Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) Conserves Battery PowerWith an 800W capacity (1000VA), the line-interactive UPS system with automatic voltage regulation (AVR) maintains regulated 120V nominal output over an input range of 83V-147V without using battery power. Conserving power allows your LiFePO4 battery to last longer and maintain full capacity until needed.6 Outlets Protect Your Mission-Critical Rack EquipmentPlug your equipment into the six NEMA 5-15R outlets. Four outlets are split into two dual-outlet load banks that are switchable via network interface. These four outlets let you power connected equipment on and off remotely to reset or reboot connected equipment or to shed less significant loads to extend battery runtime for more critical equipment. All six outlets are protected by 570-joule network-grade surge protection to fight off damaging power surges and spikes.Premium Protection from EMI/RFI Line Noise Helps Your Equipment Perform BetterThis UPS system filters out disruptive electromagnetic and radio frequency interference that can inflict hardware damage or data loss. This EMI/RFI filtering also helps your connected components perform better and last longer.High Efficiency Helps the Environment and Your Cash FlowOperating with a high 95% line-mode efficiency, the 1kVA UPS system can save BTU heat output and energy costs.Advanced Communications Ports Connect to Any Workstation or ServerUSB and DB9 ports (cables are included) enable data-saving unattended shutdown when used with Tripp Lite's free downloadable PowerAlert software. Capabilities include detailed monitoring of equipment load levels, self-test data and utility power condition. The Emergency Power Off (EPO) interface offers options for instantaneous power-off of the UPS system and connected equipment in case of fire or other facility emergency.Optional Network Management Cards Allow Detailed Monitoring of ConditionsThe SMART1000RM2UL is compatible with Tripp Lite network management cards, such as WEBCARDLX, for detailed monitoring of UPS and site power conditions.Multi-Function LCD and Audible Alarms Keep You InformedThe front-panel LCD information and configuration screen displays detailed UPS and site power status and operating data, as well as input and output voltage, operating mode, alarm function and additional options. An alarm sounds to warn you of power failure, low battery, overload, UPS fault and remote shutdown conditions. The LCD screen rotates for easy viewing in rack-mount or tower configuration.Versatile Installation OptionsHardware is included for mounting the Tripp Lite SmartPro UPS system in 2U of space in an EIA-standard 19-inch 4-post rack. Use the 2POSTRMKITWM (sold separately) for 2-post rack mounting or wall mounting or the UPSHDEARKIT (sold separately) for 2-post front-mount installation. Use the 2-9USTAND (sold separately) for mounting in an upright tower position. A 10-foot power cord with NEMA 5-15P plug connects the SMART1000RM2UL to a compatible AC power source."

It supports distances up to 400 meters (1/4 miles) and provides resilient operation in inclement weather. And, ease of deployment dramatically simplifies the skills needed to deploy point to point connections. The 60GHz radios include the ability to auto-adjust the radios between two APs that are only crudely aligned. These APs are fully integrated into the Aruba portfolio and supported with on premise and cloud-based management.In today's mobile era users are expecting to be connected everywhere and at any time. With the ever-growing number of IoT devices, there will be even more demand to provide reliable connectivity between two buildings or structures. Legacy point-to-point solutions can be expensive, and are vulnerable to weather conditions. They can also require highly skilled workers for installation and more importantly to ensure proper alignment of the APs.Use cases range from connecting remote buildings to providing high bandwidth to a temporary event site. Point-to-point solutions offer an attractive option for linking two sites where a right of way is difficult to obtain, to provide a backup for existing fiber connections, or as a recovery link in the event of a line cut or crushed or flooded conduit.The AP-387 is a dual radio solution that includes separate 5 and 60GHz radios for high performance point to point requirements, even in extreme outdoor weather use cases.A maximum concurrent data rate of 2.5 Gbps in the 60GHz band and 867 Mbps in the 5GHz band (for an aggregate peak on air data rate of 3.37 Gbps) is supported."

Both computers share one DisplayPort monitor, USB keyboard and USB mouse, which saves space on your desk or workspace. The B032-DPUA2 works with Windows, Mac and Linux.Built-In Cables for Fast and Simple SetupAll necessary cables are built right into the KVM switch. Connect your monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers to the switch's console ports. Then, connect the DisplayPort, USB and 3.5 mm audio cables to the appropriate ports on your computers. The plug-and-play KVM switch requires no software, drivers or external power supply, so you can connect and use it immediately. Use the built-in remote port selector for quick and easy toggling between computers. In addition, the remote port selector allows you to enable/disable your monitor's auto-detection mode preventing lost productivity while waiting for your monitor to turn back on. Green LEDs indicate which computer is currently selected.Connect a USB Hub to Share Peripherals between ComputersBy connecting a powered USB hub (not included) to the USB console mouse port, you'll be able to share multiple USB peripherals, such as printers, hard drives, scanners, webcams and flash drives, between the two computers.Transmits Crystal-Clear 4K Video and Digital AudioTo send digital audio and Ultra High Definition video to a 4K-ready DisplayPort television, projector or monitor, connect the corresponding port to the display using a DisplayPort cable (such as Tripp Lite's P580-Series DP cables, sold separately). The KVM switch supports Ultra HD video resolutions up to 4096 x 2160 (4K x 2K) at 30 Hz."		B032-DPUA2,Q9V03A,Q9Y41AAE
